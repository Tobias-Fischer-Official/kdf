<P>
The ProductAction class is the base class for all beans that can be added to
 the product tree in a Universal project. All of the beans provided with
 the Universal software are extended from this class. All custom beans
 that are to be added to the product tree should also extend this class.
 <P>
 Product actions should have no UI associated with them at runtime. User
 interaction should be handled through wizard beans, specifically wizard
 panels. Their purpose is to manipulate the target machine in some way (e.g.,
 installing files, changing system settings, creating desktop icons, etc.).
 Universal provides a rich set of functionality for modifying the target
 machine through the services API.
 <P>
 When writing custom product actions, the developer should understand the
 following:
 <ul>
 <li>When the developer chooses to build their Universal project,
 Universal invokes the "build" method for each product action. Product
 actions are responsible for building themselves. The most common processing
 performed at build time is to add resources (files, classes, required
 services) to the installer archive produced by the build.
 <li>When an end user executes the installer archive, for each product action
 that is visited, the Universal framework invokes the "install" method.
 Product actions need to include any code necessary to install themselves in
 the "install" method.
 <li>When the user uninstalls a product, the Universal framework invokes
 the "uninstall" method for each product action that is being uninstalled.
 </ul>
